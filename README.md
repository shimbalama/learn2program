To get started you need these scripts and Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) . Python is the lanuage and Anaconda is a lot of useful libraries including the notebook. When you install Anaconda tick '√Ådd Anaconda to the system PATH' in the advanced options. Also leave ticked the second box - 'Register Anaconda'. You might notice that this make downloading python redundant - we mainly want that for IDLE.

Advanced - vimrc.
